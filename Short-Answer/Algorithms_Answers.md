#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) This snippet is O(log n) or O(n). I am leaning toward log n.


b) This snippet is O(n2) because it is a nested loop. Every time this code is executed the runtime complexity is exponentiated. 


c) This snippet is O(n) because bunnies is equivalent to n. It is being called n times before it reaches the base case.
